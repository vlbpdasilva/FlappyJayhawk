    """The Jayhawk that the player will be controlling.
    The Jayhawk will ascend or descend and its main objective is to avoid
    colliding with pipes. Ascending will occur when the player hits up/space.
    Descending will occur when the player is not causing the Jayhawk to
    ascend. Colliding with pipes will cause the Jayhawk to lose health.
    At 0 health, the player loses the game.

                        they are only here as an example of documentation for now)
    x: The bird's X coordinate.
    y: The bird's Y coordinate.
    msec_to_climb: The number of milliseconds left to climb, where a
        complete climb lasts Bird.CLIMB_DURATION milliseconds.
    Constants:
    WIDTH: The width, in pixels, of the bird's image.
    HEIGHT: The height, in pixels, of the bird's image.
    SINK_SPEED: With which speed, in pixels per millisecond, the bird
        descends in one second while not climbing.
    CLIMB_SPEED: With which speed, in pixels per millisecond, the bird
        ascends in one second while climbing, on average.  See also the
        Bird.update docstring.
    CLIMB_DURATION: The number of milliseconds it takes the bird to
        execute a complete climb.
